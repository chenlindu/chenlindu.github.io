## 📢 Announcement

- I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at Peking University School of Stomatology.
- My research applies artificial intelligence to dentistry, with emphasis on foundation models, intelligent agents, and multimodal large language models.
 - Collaboration in research is welcome. Contact: <a href="mailto:dcchenlin@icloud.com">dcchenlin@icloud.com</a>.

## 🎯 Bio

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Peking University School of Stomatology. I received my Ph.D. in Biomedical Engineering from Tsinghua University (2020–2025) and my B.Eng. in Electronic Science and Technology from Beijing Jiaotong University (2016–2020). My work focuses on building clinically aligned AI systems for dentistry—leveraging foundation models, multimodal LLMs, and agent-based pipelines to improve diagnostic accuracy, treatment planning, and workflow efficiency.

## Research Overview

- Foundation models for dental and medical imaging
- Multimodal large language models for clinical decision support
- Intelligent agents for end‑to‑end clinical workflows
- Data‑efficient learning and robust deployment in clinical settings
