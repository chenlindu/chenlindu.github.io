## 📢 Announcement

- I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at Peking University School of Stomatology.
- My research applies artificial intelligence to dentistry, with emphasis on foundation models, intelligent agents, and multimodal large language models.
 - Collaboration in research is welcome. Contact: <a href="mailto:dcchenlin@icloud.com">dcchenlin@icloud.com</a>.

## 🎯 Bio

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Peking University School of Stomatology. 🎓 I received my Ph.D. in Biomedical Engineering from Tsinghua University (Supervisor: Prof. Zongjiu Zhang, Vice Dean of Tsinghua Medicine), and my B.Eng. in Electronic Science and Technology from Beijing Jiaotong University (Supervisor: Prof. Yanfeng Li). 🧠 My research focuses on clinically aligned dental AI, including foundation models, multimodal large language models, and agent‑based systems; 🦷 the goal is to improve diagnostic accuracy, treatment planning, and workflow efficiency.

## Research Overview

- Foundation models for dental and medical imaging
- Multimodal large language models for clinical decision support
- Intelligent agents for end‑to‑end clinical workflows
- Data‑efficient learning and robust deployment in clinical settings
